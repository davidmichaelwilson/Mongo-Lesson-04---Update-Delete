# Instructions

Unfortunately, some malicious users have created accounts
at your company's website with names like 'Stinky P00' 
and 'WillDo Anything4Robux'. Your bosses need you
to create a tool that will be used internally to 
easily update and delete user accounts. Importantly,
your tool needs to be usable by anyone in your
company regardless of their technical knowledge.

A frontend engineer has already created a simple 
user interface for you in the 'public' directory.
Your job is to wire up the existing frontend to 
the company's database using your Express backend.

You will need to add code inside 'script.js' that
responds when the 'Continue' button is pressed.
You will also need to create routes in 'index.js'
that respond to requests from the frontend.
That's all you've been told, so the rest is up to you!
